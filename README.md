***AQA Non-exam assessment 2025 submission***

### Purpose
The app is designed to bring together companies and investors on a unified platform;
individuals can register their companies and asking requirements for potential investors
(be it age, minimum investment capacity, etc.).

Individuals may also record their own details in this fashion,
and so the app can match the two together --
creating a seamless flow of collaboration and easing social interaction in the business world.

### Requirements to run
Python 3.12 and KivyMD 2.0.1 were used alongside their respective dependencies.

```
pip install kivymd2==2.0.1
```

SQLite3,
which is part of the Python standard library,
was also used.
Note that the app was not designed to work on a network and the database behaviour is merely local,
(i.e. for demonstrative purposes).
Changes will not be reflected on other instances of the app.

Run *main.py* to start the app.

### Code usage
The code is NOT free for redistribution nor plagiarism,
or any behaviour that violates AQA's rights or agreements.
I declare the code to be my own private work,
altered only by me and only under my discretion.
The code is uploaded for preservation purposes and NOT
